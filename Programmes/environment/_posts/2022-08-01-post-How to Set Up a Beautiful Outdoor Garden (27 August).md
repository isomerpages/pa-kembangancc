	<p>Edible gardens need not look boring. With a well thought out design, careful selection and inclusion of suitable plants, you can create a beautiful garden blooming with colours and textures, and teeming with garden wildlife.</p>		
	<p>In this talk, Dr Wilson Wong will bring you through how you can create an aesthetically pleasing and productive edible garden in the tropics. The sharing will conclude with some learning and reading resources that are available in NLB.</p>

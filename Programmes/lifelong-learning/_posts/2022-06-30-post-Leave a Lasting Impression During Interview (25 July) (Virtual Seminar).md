	<p><u>Synopsis</u></p>
	<p>Interviewers quickly form their assumptions of job seekers within the first thirty seconds to a minute of interaction. Such impressions can be positive or negative, but they are often lasting in nature. To accelerate your chances to secure a job offer, you need to ace during a job interview. Yet, your performance is contingent on your prior due diligence and keen preparation. Only then you can establish your presence and confidence.</p>

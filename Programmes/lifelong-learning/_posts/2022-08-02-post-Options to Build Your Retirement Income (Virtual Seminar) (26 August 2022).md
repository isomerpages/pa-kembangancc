Workforce Singapore (WSG) is organising a walk-in interview at Heartbeat@Bedok on 9 June 2022 that will feature career resources for Back-to-Work women (male jobseekers are welcome to participate too).

If you are currently a stay-home mum or caregiver who is looking to transition back to the workforce, or simply looking for more ways to empower yourself in your career, be sure not to miss it!

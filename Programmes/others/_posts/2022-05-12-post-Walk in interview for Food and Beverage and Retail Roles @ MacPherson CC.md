Small-scale thematic walk-in interviews will be held in the community with 2-4 employers. Employers will conduct interviews either virtually or on-site at the event, while jobseekers will be facilitated to the interviews on-site, with safety management measures in place. 

Jobseekers are highly encouraged to pre-register for physical walk-in interviews. Please arrive early on the event day to secure your interview slot. Walk-ins will be accepted, but subjected to event capacity limit. Pre-registration for Virtual Job Interviews are mandatory for online event access.

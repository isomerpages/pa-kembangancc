_Kolam_, which means “beauty” in Tamil and also known as Rangoli, is a floor drawing artwork made with coloured flour that adorns the entryways of homes during Deepavali or other celebratory festivals. Join us for an interactive hands-on session in person to learn to make your own _Kolam_ art piece!

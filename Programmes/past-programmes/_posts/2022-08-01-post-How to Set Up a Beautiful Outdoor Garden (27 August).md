<p>Edible gardens need not look boring. With a well thought out design, careful
selection and inclusion of suitable plants, you can create a beautiful
garden blooming with colours and textures, and teeming with garden wildlife.</p>
<p>In this talk, Dr Wilson Wong will bring you through how you can create
an aesthetically pleasing and productive edible garden in the tropics.
The sharing will conclude with some learning and reading resources that
are available in NLB.</p>

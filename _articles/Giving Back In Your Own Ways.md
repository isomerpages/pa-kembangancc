#### Meet Jarel Tang, Kampong Kembangan CC YEC ####
One of his first activities with the YEC was a back- to school outing for children, aged six to 14 living in rental blocks in Chai Chee estate. "As we began
to build relationships with them, we realised that it wasn’t enough to have a one-off programme to mentor and help these kids,” he explains. “So we decided to start the Homework Club in 2013. The twice-weekly programme sees volunteers tutoring children from low-income families.”

“I didn’t want to stop giving back to the community after my graduation, so I joined the Kampong Kembangan CC Youth Executive Committee (YEC) in 2013,” says the 21 year-old (at the time), who travelled to the United Kingdom to study
Economics. 

Besides academic support, the initiative also allows beneficiaries to participate in activities, such as dragonboating and cookery classes. Explaining the team’s decision to organise such events, Jarel says, “These help to develop self-confidence. It also shows the children that there are many pathways
to success. Our goal is to give every child a fair shot in life, regardless of their circumstances." He adds that he hopes to continue volunteering, even when
he returns to Singapore during his school holidays. “Volunteering has opened my eyes to the diversity of our society and it constantly reminds me to be grateful for the little things I have in life.”

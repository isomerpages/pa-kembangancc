Meet Alvin, he is one of many unsung heroes at Kembangan-Chai Chee who roll up their sleeves to help out our residents in need. 👏🏼

K-CC Grassroots Organisations has been working
with Fridge Restock Community (FRC) to provide rescued
fruits and vegetables collected from Pasir Panjang
Warehouse Centre.

The objective is to be eco-friendly, which focus on
sustainability and help to reduce food wastage in
Singapore. As a result of participating in the project, residents learn
that “ugly fruits and vegetables” can be used to prepare
nutritious meals albeit with a little personal creativity.

The initiatives also brought people together and step
forward to community volunteering.

K-CC has set up 5 distribution points to-date with about 300
residents in all benefiting from the rescued fruits and
vegetables. K-CC also installed 2 physical community fridges
within the division to allow residents to have ease of
collection if they are physically present during the allotted
distribution schedule.

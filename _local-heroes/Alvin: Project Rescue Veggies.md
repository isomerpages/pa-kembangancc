<b>	About Kembangan-Chai Chee Project Rescue Veggies</b>

Kembangan-Chai Chee Grassroots Organisations has been working with Fridge Restock Community (FRC) to provide rescued fruits and vegetables collected from Pasir Panjang Warehouse Centre.

The objective is to be eco-friendly, which focus on sustainability and help to reduce food wastage in Singapore. As a result of participating in the project, residents learn that ‚Äúugly fruits and vegetables‚Äù can be used to prepare nutritious meals albeit with a little personal creativity. The initiatives also brought people together and step forward to community volunteering.

Kembangan-Chai Chee  has set up 5 distribution points to-date with about 300 residents in all benefiting from the rescued fruits and vegetables. Kembangan-Chai Chee  also installed 2 physical community fridges within the division to allow residents to have ease of collection if they are physically present during the allotted distribution schedule.

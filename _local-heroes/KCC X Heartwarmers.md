It was great to see so many happy faces at our monthly Project 100=50 last Wednesday. It was a huge success and ran like clockwork because of our dedicated team of volunteers who chaperoned our residents to and from the event. Kudos to our volunteers, grassroots leaders and community partners for making Project 100=50 a success! Check out the photos in the post below.

Organised by Heartwarmers Volunteer Group and Kembangan-Chi Chee social team, Project 100=50 offers low and middle income families an opportunity to purchase their daily necessities at subsidised rates. This is one of the many local assistance schemes to help our vulnerable residents living in Kembangan-Chai Chee. 

Do drop us a message if you would like to find out more about our assistance schemes!

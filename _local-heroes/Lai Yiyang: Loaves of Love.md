"This project has help to bind residents within K-CC community together, and collectively we get to know the residents and improve the environment of Chai Chee as a whole."

Indeed, we are grateful to have many dedicated volunteers who support our projects over the years. One of our volunteers, Lai Yiyang has volunteered with us since the early days of The Bread Project: Loaves of Love. In this video, he shares his experience as a volunteers and explains what keeps him coming back to help his community.
